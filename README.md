## List of requirements (ranked from easy to hard)

## High level hardware block diagram for the application. 
* For an example, look at the example given in class slides of the high-level hardware diagram for the VGA generator.
* Each major module (hardware block) must be shown with the signals between blocks identified.
* A  good way to make this is to modularize your project and define the major modules (like you did for the practical portion of exam 2). Then you can use Vivado to generate the top-level hardware diagram for you!
